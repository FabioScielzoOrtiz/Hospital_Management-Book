# Hospital Management

Project of operation research with linear and integer optimization.

ðŸ”» Context of the problem:

A new hospital has opened in Madrid and they need operations research methods to design their care system.

On any given day, the hospital has a list of patients to attend, as they have medical appointments, while sudden emergencies are not attended. The hospital services, based on their experience, rank patients from least to most severe, on a scale of one to ten, information that will be crucial in determining the distribution of time among patients.

ðŸ”» Objective:

To maximise the time spent per patient, taking into account their severity, while maintaining good working conditions for nurses and doctors.
